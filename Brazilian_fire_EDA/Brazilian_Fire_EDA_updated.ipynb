# The choropleth map above lends more clarity to the patterns we previously observed in the cluster map. 
# >* From this map, we see that the states with more fire occurrences cluster together around the mid region of the country. This suggests that geographical location tends to be an important factor in play here. Further digging will most likely reveal interesting features that states in this region have in common which predisposes them to wildfires, and probably how these features are depressed or absent in the states outside this region. These features may be meterological and even socioeconomical.

# * The pattern on the map above is similar - with few differences - to that on the first choropleth map. It is just sublte and may be somewhat difficult to see. This is because we have the total number of fires in one year as compared to total number of fires from 19 years, and this affects the shades of the color on the map. 
# >* For example, states in the mid region which had light shades of red now have light blue (Tocantins, Bahia, Minas Gerais etc), and correspondingly, other states that had light blue now have deep blue (Amazonas, Rondonia, Acre etc)
# * The few diferences observed include states like Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul which were low in the number of fires in the the former map but high in the one above
# * Also note there is a wide margin between the number of fires in Mato Grosso and every other state, as seen in its deep red coloration. Though Mato Grosso experiences a lot of fires, as seen in the first choropleth map, its extremely high number of fires - compared with other states - in 2017 warrants further investigation 

# %%
#to buttress the last point, Mato Grosso had over 1000 fires more than the state that was second place to it.
